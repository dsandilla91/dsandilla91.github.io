Greetings to anyone reading this!  I'm Deborah and have zero knowledge of software engineering!haha  I'm sure I'm not alone.  I'm excited to see how it goes and what i will learn throughout the course.  I have pretty much been in every industry in the workplace I think, trying not to exaggerate haha.  I've worked in tourism/hotel, financial, retail etc.  I'm 28 and I've been told it's normal for recent graduates to do this so it makes sense to me I guess.  It takes a certain number of jobs until you feel comfortable with where youre at.  Anyway's I stumbled upon an ad on insta about this software engineering class-- it grabbed my attention because apparently you can finish in a matter of months and I thought why not!?  You make a good earning and it's a growing industry --jobs everywhere.  Makes me think why I didnt purse an career specifically in this!  Anyways it's never too late, so Im excited to meet motivated people like me that are just as excited about it.
